# atomic-pickaxe
Randomly generate a word/term/label/name/whatever from 2 random english words, like Atomic Pickaxe!

DEFAULT GENERATION:

note the output looks a bit nicer in an actual terminal ;)

default generation will bash 2 words together with wreckless abandon like such:

0. SEBUM-MOPERS                                 noun-noun
1. TOWER-CONDENSATION                       wildcard-noun
2. CRUMMY-UNWEBBED                                adj-adj
3. REREGULATES-BILLIONTHS                       verb-noun
4. INFIBULATES-OPAL                         verb-wildcard
5. LACE-GHEBERS                                 noun-noun
6. MISOGYNISTIC-SYPHILOID                         adj-adj
7. TRANSFORMED-SALT                          adj-wildcard
8. NUBBLE-FERMATAS                              noun-noun
9. SPIRELESS-ARTIEST                              adj-adj

The default wordlists included have some multi-worded terms in them (such as Cast-Offs, Argus-Eyed and Ill-Conceived).
The wordlists are found in files/ where files/wildcards are words you personally enjoy the look and sound of, so naturally you need to add to it yourself.

CUSTOM GENERATION:

Pick from Verb, Noun, Adjective, Wildcard, Random for each word, and generate an output accordingly (Example output with verb-noun):

ALLITERATION:

Alliteration can be enabled globally, while it's not perfect, it works surprisingly well enough. If enabled, it will affect default and custom generation.

DISCLAIMER:
I am most certainly not liable or responsible for any potentially insensitive or offensive terms that may be randomly generated. It happens, the word files are big, and if you find you don't want to risk being randomly thrown into a depression you can manually edit the noun/verb/adjective files and remove any potential triggers. Changing the length of the files should not affect functionality.

If you find the script is generating words and terms that are both terrifyingly accurate and eerily relevant to the modern world or your life, then well, like me, your computer has gained a mild sense of sentience. Common signs of this are PANDEMIC-UNENDING and INVISIBLE-CAREER
