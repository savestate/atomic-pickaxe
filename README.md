# atomic-pickaxe
Randomly generate a word/term/label/name/whatever from 2 random english words, like Atomic Pickaxe!

classicNameGen.py will just bash 2 words together with wreckless abandon like such (Default Functionalities as of 2022-01-24):

0. ARGUS-EYED-INCERTITUDE adj-noun
1. CAVALIERLY-PLATINUM adj-wildcard
2. DISASSOCIATING-MAINTAINERS verb-noun
3. UNLINKS-CAMASS verb-noun
4. ILL-CONCEIVED-CROTCHED adj-adj
5. TRIP-TOT verb-verb
6. BREECHLESS-BERGAMOTS adj-noun
7. UNSTRAPS-CRASH-DIVES verb-verb
8. HOKEY-WOUNDED adj-noun
9. SOLUBILIZES-CHOPPED verb-verb

The default wordlists included have some multi-worded terms in them (such as Argus-Eyed and Ill-Conceived, as seen above).

You have the option of saving via the listed index, or one-by-one if you choose to save without specification. It is not uncommon if on the default setting for you to have to run it a number times for it to produce something kind of cool or worth saving, sometimes you'll also find yourself saving 2-4 in the same batch, rng is rng is rng.

The wordlists are found in files/ where files/wildcards are words you personally enjoy the look and sound of, so naturally you need to add to it yourself.

If you find the script is generating words and terms that are both terrifyingly accurate and eerily relevant to the modern world or your life, then well, like me, your computer has gained a mild sense of sentience. Common signs of this are PANDEMIC-UNENDING and INVISIBLE-CAREER


DISCLAIMER:
I am most certainly not liable or responsible for any potentially insensitive or offensive terms that may be randomly generated. It happens, the word files are big, and if you find you don't want to risk being randomly thrown into a depression you can manually edit the noun/verb/adjective files and remove any potential triggers. Changing the length of the files should not affect functionality.
